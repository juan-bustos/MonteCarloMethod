## MonteCarlo

### Exercise - Value Types and Arrays COURSE: ISTA 220.

# Procedure
#### :heavy_check_mark: Create a struct to hold x, y coordinates as doubles. 
#### :heavy_check_mark: Provide a 2-parameter constructor which takes a new set of coordinates and a 1-parameter constructor which takes a Random object and uses the NextDouble method to initialize X and Y.
#### :heavy_check_mark: Create a function which takes an x, y coordinate struct and returns a double corresponding to the hypotenuse of a triangle with sides of lengths x, y.
#### :heavy_check_mark: Build a Main method which takes one int parameter from the command line and creates an array of that length containing randomly initialized coordinates.
#### :heavy_check_mark: Iterate over the array, incrementing a counter for each coordinate which overlaps the unit circle.
#### :heavy_check_mark: Using the Length parameter of the array, divide the number of coordinates overlapping the unit circle by the number of array elements. 
#### :heavy_check_mark: Multiply this value by 4.
#### :white_large_square: Print the value from step #4 along with the absolute value of the difference between your estimate of and Math.Pi.
#### :heavy_check_mark: Run your program, passing 10, 100, 1000, and 10000 as the command line parameter. Record the output of your program.
